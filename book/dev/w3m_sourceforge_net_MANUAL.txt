Introduction
w3m is a pager/text-based WWW browser. You can browse local documents and/or documents on the WWW using a terminal emulator.

Options
Command line usage is
w3m [options] [file|URL]

If you specify filenames/URLs on command line, these documents are displayed. If you specify nothing, w3m reads a document from standard input and
display it. If no filename and/or URLs are specified and standard input is tty, w3m terminates without displaying anything.
Options are as follows:

Mouse operation
If w3m is compiled with mouse option and you are using xterm/kterm/rxvt (in this case, you have to set the TERM environment variable to `xterm' or `kterm'.)
or GPM environment, you can use mouse for the navigation.
left click Move the cursor to the place pointed by the mouse cursor. If you click the cursor and it is on an anchor, follow the anchor.
middle
Back to the previous buffer.
click
right click Open pop-up menu. You can choose an item by clicking it.
Scroll document. The default behavior is to grab the document and drag it. You can reverse the behavior (grab the window and drag it) with the
left drag
option setting panel.

Key customization
You can customize the key binding (except line-editing keymap) by describing ~/.w3m/keymap. For example,
keymap C-o NEXT_PAGE

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

binds `NEXT_PAGE' function (normally bound to SPC and C-v) to control-o. See README.func for list of available functions. Original and Lynx-like keymap
definitions are provided (keymap.default and keymap.lynx) as examples.

Local CGI
You can run CGI scripts using w3m, without any HTTP server. It means that w3m behaves like an HTTP server and activates CGI script, then w3m reads the
output of the script and display it. The bookmark registration and helper-app editor are realized as local CGI scripts. Using local CGI, w3m can be used as a
general purpose form interface.
For security reason, CGI scripts invoked by w3m must be in one of these directories.
The directory where w3m-related files are stored (typically /usr/local/lib/w3m). This directory can be referred as $LIB.
/cgi-bin/ directory. You can map /cgi-bin/ to any directory you like with option setting panel (``Directory corresponds to /cgi-bin'' field). You can specify
multiple paths separated by `:', like /usr/local/cgi-bin:/home/aito/cgi-bin. It is not recommended to include current directory to this path.
The CGI script can use special header `w3m-control:' to control w3m. This field can take any function (see README.func), and the specified function is
invoked after the document is displayed. For example, The CGI output
Content-Type: text/plain
W3m-control: BACK

will display blank page and delete that buffer immediately. This is useful when you don't want to display any page after the script is invoked. The next example
Content-Type: text/plain
W3m-control: DELETE_PREVBUF
contents.....

will override the current buffer.
One w3m-control: header have to contain only one function, but you can include more than one w3m-control: lines in the HTTP header. In addition, you can
specify an argument to GOTO function:
Content-Type: text/plain
W3m-control: GOTO http://www.yahoo.com/

This example works exactly the same way to the Location header:
Content-Type: text/plain
Location: http://www.yahoo.com/

Note that this header has no effect when the CGI script is invoked through HTTP server.
