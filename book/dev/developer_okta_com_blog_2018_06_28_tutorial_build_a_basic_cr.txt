Tutorial: Build a Basic CRUD App with Node.js
Randall Degges
Node.js is eating the world. Many of the largest companies are building more and more of their websites and API services with Node.js,
and there’s no sign of a slowdown. I’ve been working with Node.js since 2012 and have been excited to see the community and tooling
grow and evolve — there’s no better time to get started with Node.js development than right now.

This tutorial will take you step-by-step through building a fully functional Node.js website. Along the way you’ll learn about Express.js, the
most popular web framework, user authentication with OpenID Connect, locking down routes to enforce login restrictions, and performing
CRUD operations with a database (creating, reading, updating, and deleting data). This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn’t
require any prior experience:
Node.js
Express.js and Pug
Okta’s OIDC-middleware and Node SDK
Sequelize.js, a popular ORM for working with databases in Node.js
If you’d like to skip the tutorial and just check out the fully built project, you can go view it on GitHub.

About Express.js
Express.js is the most popular web framework in the Node.js ecosystem. It’s incredibly simple and minimalistic. Furthermore, there are
thousands of developer libraries that work with Express, making developing with it fun and flexible.

Regardless of whether you’re trying to build a website or an API, Express.js provides tons of features and a nice developer experience.
Through this tutorial, you’ll be building a simple blog. The blog you build will have a homepage that lists the most recent posts, a login
page where users can authenticate, a dashboard page where users can create and edit posts, and logout functionality.
The blog will be built using Express.js, the user interface will be built using Pug, the authentication component will be handled by Okta,
and the blog post storage and database management will be handled by Sequelize.js.

Create Your Express.js App
Before we begin, make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. If you don’t already have Node.js installed, please visit this
page and install it for your operating system before continuing.
To get your project started quickly you can leverage express-generator. This is an officially maintained program that allows you to easily
scaffold an Express.js website with minimal effort.
To install express-generator run:

npm install -g express-generator

Next, you need to initialize your project. To do this, use the newly installed express-generator program to bootstrap your application:
express --view pug blog
cd blog
npm install
npm start

The above command will initialize a new project called blog, move you into the new project folder, install all project dependencies, and
start up a web server.
Once you’ve finished running the commands above, point your favorite browser to http://localhost:3000 and you should see
your application running:

Initialize Authentication
Dealing with user authentication in web apps is a huge pain for every developer. This is where Okta shines: it helps you secure your web
applications with minimal effort. To get started, you’ll need to create an OpenID Connect application in Okta. Sign up for a forever-free
developer account (or log in if you already have one).

Once you’ve logged in and land on the dashboard page, copy down the Org URL pictured below. You will need this later.

Then create a new application by browsing to the Applications tab and clicking Add Application.

PDFCROWD

Next, click the Web platform option (since our blog project is a web app).

On the settings page, enter the following values:
Name: Blog
Base URIs: http://localhost:3000
Login redirect URIs: http://localhost:3000/users/callback

You can leave all the other values unchanged.

Now that your application has been created, copy down the Client ID and Client secret values on the following page, you’ll need them
soon.

Finally, create a new authentication token. This will allow your app to talk to Okta to retrieve user information, among other things. To do
this, click the API tab at the top of the page followed by the Create Token button. Give your token a name, preferably the same name as
your application, then click Create Token. Copy down this token value as you will need it soon.

Install Dependencies
The first thing you need to do in order to initialize your Express.js app is install all of the required dependencies.
npm install express@4.16.3
npm install @okta/oidc-middleware@0.1.2
npm install @okta/okta-sdk-nodejs@1.1.0
npm install sqlite3@4.0.1
npm install sequelize@4.38.0
npm install async@2.6.1
npm install slugify@1.3.0
npm install express-session@1.15.6

Define Database Models with Sequelize
The first thing I like to do when starting a new project is define what data my application needs to store, so I can model out exactly what
data I’m handling.
Create a new file named ./models.js and copy the following code inside of it.
const Sequelize = require("sequelize");
const db = new Sequelize({
dialect: "sqlite",
storage: "./database.sqlite"
});
const Post = db.define("post", {
title: { type: Sequelize.STRING },
body: { type: Sequelize.TEXT },
authorId: { type: Sequelize.STRING },
slug: { type: Sequelize.STRING }
});
db.sync();
module.exports = { Post };

This code initializes a new SQLite database that will be used to store the blog data and also defines a model called Post which stores
blog posts in the database. Each post has a title, a body, an author ID, and a slug field.
Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

The title field will hold the title of a post, eg: “A Great Article”
The body field will hold the body of the article as HTML, eg: “<p>My first post!</p>”
The authorId field will store the author’s unique ID. This is a common pattern in relational databases: store just the identifier of a
linked resource so you can look up the author’s most up-to-date information later.
The slug field will store the URL-friendly version of the post’s title, eg: “a-great-article”
NOTE: If you’ve never used SQLite before, it’s amazing. It’s a database that stores your data in a single file. It’s great for building

applications that don’t require a large amount of concurrency, like this simple blog.
The call to db.sync(); at the bottom of the file will automatically create the database and all of the necessary tables once this
JavaScript code runs.

Initialize Your Express.js App
The next thing I like to do after defining my database models is to initialize my application code. This typically involves:
Configuring application settings
Installing middlewares that provide functionality to the application
Handling errors
Etc.
Open the ./app.js file and replace its contents with the following code.
const createError = require("http-errors");
const express = require("express");
l
i ("
")

const path = require("path");
const okta = require("@okta/okta-sdk-nodejs");

const blogRouter = require("./routes/blog");
const usersRouter = require("./routes/users");

});
});

app.use("/users", usersRouter);
// Error handlers
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
next(createError(404));
});
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
res.locals.message = err.message;
res.locals.error = req.app.get("env") === "development" ? err : {};
res.status(err.status || 500);

res.status(err.status || 500);
res.render("error");
});

module.exports = app;

Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.
Replace {yourOktaOrgUrl} with the Org URL on your dashboard page
Replace {yourOktaClientId} with the Client ID on your application page
Replace {yourOktaClientSecret} with the Client secret on your application page
Replace {aLongRandomString} with a long random string (just mash your fingers on the keyboard for a second)
Let’s take a look at what this code does.

Initialize Node.js Middlewares
Middlewares in Express.js are functions that run on every request. There are many open source middlewares you can install and use to
add functionality to your Express.js applications. The code below uses several popular Express.js middlewares, as well as defines some
new ones.
// Middleware
app.use(logger("dev"));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
issuer: "{yourOktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/default",
client_id: "yourOktaClientId}",
client_secret: "{yourOktaClientSecret}",
redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000/users/callback",
scope: "openid profile",
routes: {
login: {
path: "/users/login"
},
callback: {
path: "/users/callback",
defaultRedirect: "/dashboard"
}
}
});
app.use(session({
secret: "{aLongRandomString}",
resave: true,
saveUninitialized: false
}));
app.use(oidc.router);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
if (!req.userinfo) {
return next();
}
client.getUser(req.userinfo.sub)
.then(user => {
req.user = user;
res.locals.user = user;
next();
});
});

});

The first few middlewares are all standard stuff: they enable logging, parse form data, and serve static files. The interesting thing to take
note of is the use of the ExpressOIDC middleware.
This middleware handles the OpenID Connect authentication logic of the application which supports login, logout, etc. The settings being
passed into the ExpressOIDC middleware are configuration options which dictate what URLs are used to log the user into the
application, and where the user will be redirected once they’ve been logged in.
The next middleware is the session middleware. This middleware is responsible for managing user cookies and remembering who a
user is. The secret it takes must be a long random string you define and keep private. This secret makes it impossible for attackers to
tamper with cookies.
The oidc.router middleware uses the settings you defined when creating ExpressOIDC to create routes for handling user
authentication. Whenever a user visits /users/login , for instance, they’ll be taken to a login page. This line of code is what makes that
possible.
Finally, there’s a custom middleware. This middleware creates a req.user object that you will be able to use later on to more easily
access a currently logged in user’s personal information.

Initialize Node.js Routes
The route code tells Express.js what code to run when a user visits a particular URL. Here is the route code from the ./app.js .

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

// Routes
app.use("/", blogRouter);
app.use("/users", usersRouter);

This code tells Express.js that in our (yet to be created) blog and user route files there are functions that should be executed when certain
URLs are hit. If a user visits a URL starting with /users , Express.js will look for other matching URLs in the user routes file. If a user visits
any URLs starting with the / URL, Express.js will look in the blog routes file to see what to do.

Initialize Error Handlers
The last bit of code in our app above is the error-handling middlewares.
// Error handlers
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
next(createError(404));
});
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
res.locals.message = err.message;
res.locals.error = req.app.get("env") === "development" ? err : {};
res.status(err.status || 500);
res.render("error");
});

These middlewares will run if any 4XX or 5XX type errors occur. In both cases, they will render a simple web page to the user showing
them the error.

Create Express.js Views
Views in Express.js are the equivalent of HTML templates—they’re the place you store front-end code and logic. The views you’ll use in
this project will use the Pug templating language which is one of the most popular.
Remove your existing views by running the following command.

rm views/*

Next, create a ./views/layout.pug file. This is a base “layout” template that all other templates will inherit from. It defines common
HTML, includes the Bootstrap CSS library, and also defines a simple navigation menu.

}
.nav {

Create Routes
Routes are where the real action happens in any Express.js application. They dictate what happens when a user visits a particular URL.
To get started, remove the existing routes that the express-generator application created.

rm routes/*

Next, create the two route files that you’ll need.

touch routes/{blog.js,users.js}

The ./routes/blog.js file will contain all of the routes related to blog functionality. The ./routes/users.js file will contain the
routes related to user functionality. While you could always put all your logic in the main ./app.js file, keeping your routes in separate
purpose-based files is a good idea.

Create User Routes
Since Okta’s oidc-middleware library is already handling user authentication for the application, there isn’t a lot of user-facing functionality
we need to create.

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

The only route you need to define that relates to user management is a logout route — this route will log the user out of their account and
redirect them to the homepage of the site. While the oidc-middleware library provides a logout helper, it doesn’t create an actual route.
Open up the ./routes/users.js file and copy in the following code.
const express = require("express");

const router = express.Router();
// Log a user out
router.get("/logout", (req, res, next) => {
req.logout();
res.redirect("/");
});

module.exports = router;

The way to understand this route is simple. When a user visits the /logout URL, a function will run that:
Uses the oidc-middleware library to log the user out of their account Redirects the now logged-out user to the homepage of the site

Create Blog Routes
Since the application you’re building is a blog, the last big piece of functionality you need add is the actual blog route code. This is what
will dictate how the blog actually works: how to create posts, edit posts, delete posts, etc.

error: {
status: 404,

module.exports = router;

NOTE: Make sure you substitute in your values for the placeholder variables towards the top of this file. You need to replace

{yourOktaOrgUrl} and {yourOktaToken} with the appropriate values.

This is a lot of code, so let’s take a look at each route and how it works.

Create an Authentication Helper
The first function you’ll notice in the blog routes is the ensureAuthenticated function.

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

// Only let the user access the route if they are authenticated.
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
if (!req.user) {
return res.status(401).render("unauthenticated");
}
next();
}

This function is a special middleware you’ll use later on that will render the unauthenticated.pug view you created earlier to tell the
user they don’t have access to view the page unless they log in.
This middleware works by looking for the req.user variable which, if it doesn’t exist, means that the user is not currently logged in. This
will be helpful later on to make sure that only logged in users can access certain pages of the site (for instance, the page that allows a
user to create a new blog post).

Create the Homepage
The index route (aka: “homepage route”) is what will run when the user visits the root of the site. It will display all blog posts ordered by
date and not much else. Here’s the route code.

PDFCROWD

// Render the home page and list all blog posts
router.get("/", (req, res) => {
models.Post.findAll({
order: sequelize.literal("createdAt DESC")
}).then(posts => {
let postData = [];
async.eachSeries(posts, (post, callback) => {
post = post.get({ plain: true });
client.getUser(post.authorId).then(user => {
postData.push({
title: post.title,
body: post.body,
createdAt: post.createdAt,
authorName: user.profile.firstName + " " + user.profile.lastName,
slug: post.slug
});
callback();
}).catch(err => {
postData.push({
title: post.title,
body: post.body,
createdAt: post.createdAt,
slug: post.slug
});
callback();
});
}, err => {
return res.render("index", { posts: postData });
});
});
});

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

The way this works is by first using Sequelize.js to retrieve a list of all blog posts from the database ordered by the createdAt field.
Whenever a new blog post is stored in the database, Sequelize.js automatically assigns it both a createdAt and updatedAt time
field.
Once a list of posts have been returned from the database you will iterate over each post retrieving it in JSON format, then use Okta’s
Node SDK to retrieve the author’s information via the authorId field.
Finally, you’ll build an array consisting of all the blog posts alongside the author’s name, and will render the index.pug template which
then takes that data and displays the full web page.

Create the Dashboard Routes
The dashboard page is the first page users will see after logging in. It will:
Allow users to create a new blog post
Show users a list of their previously created blog posts
Provide buttons that allow a user to edit or delete previously created blog posts
Here’s the code that powers the dashboard route.
// Render the user dashboard
router.get("/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res, next) => {
models.Post.findAll({
where: {
authorId: req.user.id
},
order: sequelize.literal("createdAt DESC")
}) then(posts

> {

PDFCROWD

}).then(posts => {
let postData = [];
posts.forEach(post => {
postData.push(post.get({ plain: true }));
});
return res.render("dashboard", { posts: postData });
});
});
// Create a new post
router.post("/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res, next) => {
models.Post.create({
title: req.body.title,
body: req.body.body,
authorId: req.user.id,
slug: slugify(req.body.title).toLowerCase()
}).then(newPost => {
models.Post.findAll({
where: {
authorId: req.user.id
},
order: sequelize.literal("createdAt DESC")
}).then(posts => {
let postData = [];
posts.forEach(post => {
postData.push(post.get({ plain: true }));
});
res.render("dashboard", { post: newPost, posts: postData });
});
});
});

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

Note that there are technically two routes here. The first route function is run when a user issues a GET request for the /dashboard
page, while the second route is run when a user issues a POST request for the /dashboard page.
The first route retrieves a list of all blog posts this user has created, then renders the dashboard page. Note how it uses the
ensureAuthenticated middleware we created earlier. By inserting the ensureAuthenticated middleware into the route, this

guarantees that this route code will only execute if a currently logged in user is visiting this page.
If a user chooses to create a new blog post, that will trigger a POST request to the /dashboard URL, which is what will eventually run
the second dashboard route shown above.
This route uses Sequelize.js to create a new database entry storing the blog posts and author details, then renders the dashboard page
once more.

Create the Edit Routes
The edit routes control the pages that allow a user to edit one of their existing blog posts. The code that makes this work is shown below.
// Render the edit post page
router.get("/:slug/edit", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res, next) => {
models.Post.findOne({
where: {
slug: req.params.slug,
authorId: req.user.id
}
}).then(post => {
if (!post) {
return res.render("error", {
message: "Page not found.",
error

{

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

error: {
status: 404,
}
});
}
post = post.get({ plain: true });
client.getUser(post.authorId).then(user => {
post.authorName = user.profile.firstName + " " + user.profile.lastName;
res.render("edit", { post });
});
});
});
// Update a post
router.post("/:slug/edit", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res, next) => {
models.Post.findOne({
where: {
slug: req.params.slug,
authorId: req.user.id
}
}).then(post => {
if (!post) {
return res.render("error", {
message: "Page not found.",
error: {
status: 404,
}
});
}
post.update({
title: req.body.title,
body: req.body.body,
slug: slugify(req.body.title).toLowerCase()
}).then(() => {
post = post.get({ plain: true });
client.getUser(post.authorId).then(user => {

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

post.authorName = user.profile.firstName + " " + user.profile.lastName;
res.redirect("/" + slugify(req.body.title).toLowerCase());
});
});
});
});

These routes by matching a variable pattern URL. If the user visits a URL that looks like /<something>/edit , then the edit route will
run. Because the URL pattern in the route is defined as /:slug/edit , Express.js will pass along the URL route in the
req.params.slug variable so you can use it.

These routes handle rendering the edit page as well as updating existing posts when needed.

Create the Delete Route
The delete route is simple: if a user sends a POST request to the URL /<post-url>/delete , then Sequelize.js will destroy the post
from the database.
Here’s the code that makes this work.

Create PDF in your applications with the Pdfcrowd HTML to PDF API

PDFCROWD

// Delete a post
router.post("/:slug/delete", (req, res, next) => {
models.Post.findOne({
where: {
slug: req.params.slug,
authorId: req.user.id
}
}).then(post => {
if (!post) {
return res.render("error", {
message: "Page not found.",
error: {
status: 404,
}
});
}
post.destroy();
res.redirect("/dashboard");
});
});

Create the Display Route
The display route is the simplest of them all: it renders a specific blog post on a page. It works much like the other routes above by using
variable URL patterns.
When a user visits a URL like /my-great-article , this route will run, query the database for any blog posts whose slug is
my-great-article , then display that post on a page.

if (!post) {
return res.render("error", {
message: "Page not found.",
error: {
status: 404,
}
});
}
post = post.get({ plain: true });
client.getUser(post.authorId).then(user => {
post.authorName = user.profile.firstName + " " + user.profile.lastName;
res.render("post", { post });
});
});
});

Hey, you must have forgotten to set the `secret` option when initializing the session middleware, eg:
app.use(session({
secret: "{aLongRandomString}",
resave: true,

}));

Thanks for the heads up Pedro. You're right that a comma was missing. The following was missing from the bottom of models.js
too, which causes the `findAll` issue you saw.
module.exports = { Post };

I've updated this tutorial with the fixes and it should work great now!
