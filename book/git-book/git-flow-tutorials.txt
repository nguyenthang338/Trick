Gitﬂow Workﬂow

Gitﬂow Workﬂow is a Git workﬂow design that was ﬁrst published
and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitﬂow
Workﬂow deﬁnes a strict branching model designed around the
project release. This provides a robust framework for managing
larger projects.  
Gitﬂow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release
cycle. This workﬂow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands
beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workﬂow. Instead,
it assigns very speciﬁc roles to different branches and deﬁnes
how and when they should interact. In addition to feature
branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining,

and recording releases. Of course, you also get to leverage all the
beneﬁts of the Feature Branch Workﬂow: pull requests, isolatedSign up
experiments, and more efﬁcient collaboration.

Getting Started
Gitﬂow is really just an abstract idea of a Git workﬂow. This
means it dictates what kind of branches to set up and how to
merge them together. We will touch on the purposes of the
branches below. The git-ﬂow toolset is an actual command line
tool that has an installation process. The installation process for
git-ﬂow is straightforward. Packages for git-ﬂow are available on
multiple operating systems. On OSX systems, you can execute
brew install git-ﬂow . On windows you will need to download

and install git-ﬂow. After installing git-ﬂow you can use it in your
project by executing git ﬂow init . Git-ﬂow is a wrapper around
Git. The git ﬂow init command is an extension of the default
git init  command and doesn't change anything in your

repository other than creating branches for you.

How it works

Develop and Master Branches
Instead of a single master branch, this workﬂow uses two
branches to record the history of the project. The master branch
stores the ofﬁcial release history, and the develop branch serves
as an integration branch for features. It's also convenient to tag
all commits in the master branch with a version number.
The ﬁrst step is to complement the default master with a develop
branch. A simple way to do this is for one developer to create an
empty develop branch locally and push it to the server:

git branch develop
git push -u origin develop

Sign up

This branch will contain the complete history of the project,
whereas master will contain an abridged version. Other
developers should now clone the central repository and create a
tracking branch for develop.
When using the git-ﬂow extension library, executing
git ﬂow init on an existing repo will create the develop branch:

$ git flow init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/project/.git/
No branches exist yet. Base branches must be created n
Branch name for production releases: [master]
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]
How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]
Version tag prefix? []
$ git branch
* develop
master

Feature Branches
Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be
pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But,
instead of branching off of master , feature branches use
develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it

gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact
directly with master .

Note that feature branches combined with the develop branch

is, for all intents and purposes, the Feature Branch Workﬂow. But,

the Gitﬂow Workﬂow doesn’t stop there.
Feature branches are generally created off to the latest develop

branch.

Creating a feature branch
Without the git-ﬂow extensions:

git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature_branch

When using the git-ﬂow extension:

git flow feature start feature_branch

Continue your work and use Git like you normally would.

Finishing a feature branch

Sign up

When you’re done with the development work on the feature, the
next step is to merge the feature_branch into develop .
Without the git-ﬂow extensions:

git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch

Using the git-ﬂow extensions:

git flow feature finish feature_branch

Release Branches

Once develop has acquired enough features for a release (or a
predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release
branch off of develop . Creating this branch starts the next
release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point—
only bug ﬁxes, documentation generation, and other releaseoriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready to ship,
the release branch gets merged into master and tagged with a
version number. In addition, it should be merged back into
develop , which may have progressed since the release was

initiated.

Using a dedicated branch to prepare releases makes it possible
for one team to polish the current release while another team

continues working on features for the next release. It also creates
well-deﬁned phases of development (e.g., it's easy to say, “This
week we're preparing for version 4.0,” and to actually see it in the
structure of the repository).
Making release branches is another straightforward branching
operation. Like feature branches, release branches are based
on the develop branch. A new release branch can be created
using the following methods.
Without the git-ﬂow extensions:

git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/0.1.0

When using the git-ﬂow extensions:

$ git flow release start 0.1.0
Switched to a new branch 'release/0.1.0'

Once the release is ready to ship, it will get merged it into master
and develop , then the release branch will be deleted. It’s

Sign up

important to merge back into develop because critical updates
may have been added to the release branch and they need to be
accessible to new features. If your organization stresses code
review, this would be an ideal place for a pull request.
To ﬁnish a release branch, use the following methods:
Without the git-ﬂow extensions:

git checkout master
git merge release/0.1.0

Or with the git-ﬂow extension:

git flow release finish '0.1.0'

Hotﬁx Branches

Maintenance or “hotﬁx” branches are used to quickly patch
production releases. Hotﬁx branches are a lot like release
branches and feature branches except they're based on master
instead of develop . This is the only branch that should fork
directly off of master . As soon as the ﬁx is complete, it should be
merged into both master and develop (or the current release
branch), and master should be tagged with an updated version
number.

Having a dedicated line of development for bug ﬁxes lets your
team address issues without interrupting the rest of the workﬂow
Sign up
or waiting for the next release cycle. You can think of
maintenance branches as ad hoc release branches that work
directly with master . A hotﬁx branch can be created using the
following methods:
Without the git-ﬂow extensions:

git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix_branch

When using the git-ﬂow extensions: 

$ git flow hotfix start hotfix_branch

Similar to ﬁnishing a release branch, a hotﬁx branch gets
merged into both master and develop.

git checkout master
git merge hotfix_branch

git merge hotfix_branch
git branch -D hotfix_branch

$ git flow hotfix finish hotfix_branch

Example
A complete example demonstrating a Feature Branch Flow is as
follows. Assuming we have a repo setup with a master branch.

git checkout master
git checkout -b develop
git checkout -b feature_branch
# work happens on feature branch
git checkout develop
git merge feature_branch
git checkout master
git merge develop
git branch -d feature_branch

In addition to the feature and release ﬂow, a hotﬁx example is
as follows:

Sign up

git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix_branch
# work is done commits are added to the hotfix_branch
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix_branch
git checkout master
git merge hotfix_branch

Summary
Here we discussed the Gitﬂow Workﬂow. Gitﬂow is one of many
styles of Git workﬂows you and your team can utilize.
Some key takeaways to know about Gitﬂow are:
The workﬂow is great for a release-based software
workﬂow.
Gitﬂow offers a dedicated channel for hotﬁxes to production.

The overall ﬂow of Gitﬂow is:
Sign up

1. A develop branch is created from master
2. A release branch is created from develop
3. Feature  branches are created from develop
4. When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop
 branch
5. When the release branch is done it is merged into develop
and master
6. If an issue in master is detected a hotﬁx branch is created
from master
7. Once the hotﬁx is complete it is merged to both develop
and master
